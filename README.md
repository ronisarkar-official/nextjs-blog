## Sanity & Type Generation

This repository includes Sanity tooling. The `typegen` script extracts the Sanity schema and generates TypeScript types. Ensure a `sanity/` directory with a valid Sanity project is present before running:

```bash
npm run typegen
```

If you are not using Sanity, remove or adapt the `typegen` steps and any Sanity imports.

---

## Scripts

* `dev` — `next dev --turbopack` (development)
* `build` — `next build --turbopack` (production build)
* `start` — `next start` (serve production)
* `lint` — run ESLint
* `typegen` — extract Sanity schema and generate types
* `predev` / `prebuild` — run `typegen` before dev/build
* `postbuild` — run `next-sitemap` after build

---

## Editors & Recommendations

Multiple editor packages are included. To keep the project maintainable and reduce bundle size, choose one editor and remove the rest. Recommendations:

* **Toast UI Editor** — excellent for markdown-heavy blogs, built-in code blocks and plugins.
* **@uiw / react-md-editor** — lightweight markdown editing with simpler UX.
* **TipTap** (not included by default) — if you need structured ProseMirror editing and collaboration later.

---

## Deployment

* **Vercel**: Recommended for seamless Next.js deployment. Add environment variables in the Vercel dashboard and deploy from the GitHub repo.
* Ensure `NEXTAUTH_SECRET` and any Sanity/Cloudinary/Stripe keys are configured in production.

---

## Development Best Practices

* Restrict canary versions for `next` / `react` in production or pin to stable releases if required.
* Strip unused editor dependencies to minimize install size and surface area.
* Run `npm run lint` before pushing PRs.
* Add CI (GitHub Actions) to run linting and build checks.
